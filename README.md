# Valocore Frontend Exercise

## About This App
Starter app built with Next.js and TailwindCSS (using `create-t3-app`), some of the tools we use here at Valocore.

You'll clone this repo and deploy it locally as part of our technical assessment.

It is _not_ a requirement that you arrive at a fully functioning solution, although that would be great.

Rather, the goal is to see what it's like to work through a problem together.

I encourage to use all the resources at your disposal:
- Google whatever you want (it's part of the job)
- Copy and paste code (also part of the job, although you should understand and be able to explain what you're copying)
- Use me as a sounding board and thought partner. We're going to be working on the same team! 

As of my writing this, this was a real scenario that I enountered and had to work through this past weekend. 

## How to run
To clone the repo locally, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/valocore/valocore-frontend-exercise
```
This will pull down the code into a directory named `valocore-frontend-exercise`.

Alternatively, you can specify a directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/valocore/valocore-frontend-exercise <your_desired_directory_here>
```

`cd` into the directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Then simply start the app.
```bash
npm run dev
```
